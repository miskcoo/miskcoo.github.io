I am a Ph.D. student (from fall, 2020) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun). 

I received my bachelor degree at Tsinghua University, majored in _Computer Science and Technology_. 
I also received my second bachelor degree at Tsinghua University, majored in _Pure and Applied Mathematics_.
